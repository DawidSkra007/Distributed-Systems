# Distributed-Systems
Welcome to the Cloud Computing module! This hands-on course covers a wide range of distributed technologies used in cloud computing environments. Each week, you will delve into a new distributed technology and work on small projects to gain practical experience. By the end of this module, you will have a solid understanding of various distributed technologies commonly used in cloud-based applications.

# Topics Covered
Throughout the course, we explored the following distributed technologies:

### Sockets ###
Description: The Sockets module introduces basic socket programming, a fundamental concept in networking. You will learn how to establish communication channels between clients and servers using sockets.

### RMI (Remote Method Invocation) ###
Description: The RMI module covers Java Remote Method Invocation, a mechanism for calling remote methods on objects in a different Java Virtual Machine. You will learn to design and implement distributed Java applications using RMI.

### Web Services-based Distribution ###
Description: This module explores Web Services, a standardized way of enabling communication between applications over the internet. You will work on projects to implement and consume Web Services for distributed communication.

### Message-Oriented Middleware-based Distribution (ActiveMQ) ###
Description: The ActiveMQ module introduces message-oriented middleware and focuses on Apache ActiveMQ as a popular messaging system. You will build projects to implement message-based communication between components.

### REST-based Distribution ###
Description: This module covers Representational State Transfer (REST), a design pattern used in web services development. You will create RESTful APIs and learn how to interact with them for distributed data exchange.

### Actor-based Distribution ###
Description: The Actor-based Distribution module introduces the Actor model, which allows concurrent and distributed systems to be built with high scalability and responsiveness. You will work on projects that leverage the Actor model to handle distributed tasks.
